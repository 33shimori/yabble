A general purpose browser-side CommonJS module loader 

Yabble is a general purpose browser-side CommonJS module loader. Other similar module loaders are available, but Yabble strives to be a flexible loader in a small package.

** NOTE: This is an early release. See below for more information **

Features:
 * Compliant with Modules 1.0
 * Supports async XHR/eval()
   - Allows the use of non-transport-wrapped module code for quick development
 * Supports script tags with a Transport format
   - Easier debugging, potential for file concatenation
 * Includes a tool for automatically wrapping modules in a Transport format
 * Supports require.ensure() for lazy-loading modules
 * Small size (<500 lines, ~13kb raw, ~4kb minified, and <2kb when minified/gzipped)

Roadmap:
 * Stability
   - Better cross-browser compliance
   - More unit tests
   - Better unit testing framework
 * Features
   - Implement support for Modules 1.1(.1)
   - Complete support for Transport/D
   - Implement support for Transport/C
   - Explicit support for concatenated Transport files in loader and tooling
 * Loader
   - Use loader code in tooling (no copy/paste code)
   - Expand supported engines for tooling (node.js)
   - Better consideration for platform (line endings, encoding, etc)

Notes on the current release:

This is the first release and is currently unsuitable for any sort of production work. The loader has passed the Module 1.0 unit tests on IE 6/7 and FF 3. While complete cross-browser support is a short-term goal, this release does not offer it.

The tooling (yabbler.js) currently supports the Rhino javascript engine and is very under-developed. It is offered as a preview of what is to come.

For example usage for both the loader and the tooling, please see the Modules 1.0 unit tests.
